## I'm ready, how can I contribute?

There are different ways to contribute to pottery, you can do whatever it suits best to your time and commitment.

* You can use pottery and provide feedback. That already helps a lot improving the tool.
* Also, share the project! If you like it, share honest feedback with the community: Pottery is clearly not perfect, but it can suit other people needs, and feedback is always useful.
* You can design new features. Create a new [Feature Request](https://github.com/kmruiz/pottery/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.md&title=) and have fun.
To be clear, sharing new feature ideas do not mean that we are going to build them as is, or even building them at all. However, feedback will be shared and reasons provided either way.
* If you are more on the coding side, you can fix [issues](https://github.com/kmruiz/pottery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) marked as `good first issue`. Feel free to take bug reports or feature requests that are not marked as `won't do`.
* You can provide bug reports. Create a new [Bug Report](https://github.com/kmruiz/pottery/issues/new?assignees=kmruiz&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+Command+X+does+not+work+as+expected.) and help the product be faster, more stable and more useful!
* You can also share Security issues within pottery by creating a [Security Issue bug report](https://github.com/kmruiz/pottery/issues/new?assignees=kmruiz&labels=security-issue&template=security-issue.md&title=).
* Writing down new documentation is also a wonderful way to start contributing. Documentation is a jekyll server in this repository, so just download it and play with the documentation.
