## What is Pottery

Pottery is a build system for Java designed to be simple, fast and easy to use.

* **Easy to use**: Just a YAML file, no complex configuration.
* **Fast**: Parallel downloads and incremental compilation by default.
* **Lightweight**: The pottery fat-jar is less than 2MB, the pottery wrapper is 1KB.
* **Ready to use**: Can compile to a library, a fatJar, a container or a native image by default.
